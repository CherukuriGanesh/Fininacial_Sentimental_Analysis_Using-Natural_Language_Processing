## Introduction
In the dynamic world of finance, sentiments play a crucial role in shaping market trends. Financial Sentiment Analysis employs state-of-the-art NLP techniques to evaluate sentiments expressed in financial content. This project provides an automated solution to sentiment extraction, which can be applied to stock prediction, risk assessment, and market analysis.

## Features
- **Input Data**: Financial news, articles, and reports.
- **Output**: Sentiment classification (Positive, Negative, Neutral).
- **Key Techniques**:
  - Text Preprocessing (Tokenization, Lemmatization, Stopword Removal)
  - Sentiment Analysis using NLP libraries
  - Machine Learning Algorithms for Classification

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - NLTK
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - TensorFlow / PyTorch (if applicable)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/financial-sentiment-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd financial-sentiment-analysis
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Prepare the dataset by placing it in the appropriate folder.
2. Run the preprocessing script to clean and tokenize the text data:
   ```bash
   python preprocess_data.py
   ```
3. Train the sentiment analysis model:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
4. Evaluate the model on test data:
   ```bash
   python evaluate_model.py
   ```
5. Use the model to analyze sentiments in new financial text data:
   ```bash
   python analyze_sentiment.py --input your_data.txt
   ```

## Results
The project achieves accurate sentiment classification with the following metrics:
- Precision: 90%
- Recall: 88%
- F1-Score: 89%
